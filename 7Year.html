<h2>7Year</h2>
Once I was seven years old my momma told me<br>
Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely<br>
Once I was seven years old<br>
It was a big big world, but we thought we were bigger<br>
Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker<br>
By eleven smoking herb and drinking burning liquor<br>
Never rich so we were out to make that steady figure<br>
Once I was eleven years old my daddy told me<br>
Go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely<br>
Once I was eleven years old<br>
I always had that dream like my daddy before me<br>
So I started writing songs, I started writing stories<br>
Something about that glory just always seemed to bore me<br>
'Cause only those I really love will ever really know me<br>
Once I was twenty years old, my story got told<br>
Before the morning sun, when life was lonely<br>
Onceâ€¦<br>
