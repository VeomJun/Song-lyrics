  <h2>I Wnat You Back - Jackson 5</h2>
  When I had you to myself, I didn't want you around<br>
Those pretty faces always make you stand out in a crowd<br>
But someone picked you from the bunch, one glance is all it took<br>
Now it's much too late for me to take a second look<br>
Oh baby, give me one more chance<br>
(To show you that I love you)<br>
Won't you please let me back in your heart<br>
Oh darlin', I was blind to let you go<br>
(Let you go, baby)<br>
But now since I've seen you it is on<br>
(I want you back)<br>
Oh I do now<br>
(I want you back)<br>
Ooh ooh baby<br>
(I want you back)<br>
Yeah yeah yeah yeah<br>
(I want you back)<br>
Na na na na<br>
Trying to live without your love is one long sleepless night<br>
Let me show you, girl, that I know wrong from right<br>
Every street you walk on, I leave tear stains on the ground<br>
Following theâ€¦<br>
